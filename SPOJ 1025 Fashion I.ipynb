    "Now the results of both fashion shows are out. The participants of both the fashion shows have decided to date each other, but as usual they have difficuly in choosing their partners. The Maximum Match dating serive (MMDS) comes to their rescue and matches them in such a way that that maximizes the hotness bonds for all couples.\n",

The third line contains N integers separated by single spaces denoting the hotness levels of the women. All hotness ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10.\n",
